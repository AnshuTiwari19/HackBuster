##Description
With the increasing focus on health and wellness, many individuals join gyms but often lack the personalized guidance needed to achieve their fitness goals effectively. This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution that integrates seamlessly with gym management systems and wearable devices. The system will collect real-time data on user activity, biometrics, and workout performance. Using this data, AI algorithms will generate personalized workout and nutrition plans tailored to each userâ€™s goals, body type, and progress. Additionally, the solution will offer actionable insights and motivational feedback to enhance engagement, ensure consistency, and improve fitness outcomes. This intelligent platform will empower users with a more informed and customized fitness journey.
